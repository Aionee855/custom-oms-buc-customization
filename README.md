# oms-buc-customization
This project is created as a quick start project for the BUC customization teams. It follows our documented conventions for application development in BUC and will be used by the teams to validate their BUC customization configuration. Once the initial setup is complete and teams are able to launch the application in BUC, they will use this as the foundation for further application development.
